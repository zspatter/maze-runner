# maze-runner
Simple Prolog program that finds a path through a maze (shortest path problem).

## What I Learned:
- Prolog syntax
- How to represent data structures in Prolog
- How to represent a graph using dictionaries
- How to traverse undirected graphs
- How to avoid visiting the same node multiple times (preventing cycles)

### Usage: 
`solve(<start point>, <end point>, P, N)`
